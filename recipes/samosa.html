    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A samosa is a fried South Asian pastry with a savoury filling, including ingredients such as spiced potatoes, onions, peas, meat, or fish. It may take different forms, including triangular, cone, or half-moon shapes, depending on the region. Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier. Sweet versions are also made. Samosas are a popular entrée, appetizer, or snack in the cuisines of South Asia, the Middle East, Central Asia, East Africa and their South Asian diasporas.</p>

        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>2 cup virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon green chilli</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cashews</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder</li>
        <li>salt as required</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coriander leaves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon ghee</li>
        <li>1 handful raw peanuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sauté cumin seeds for potato filling. To make delicious samosas at home, first, make the filling. Put a pan on medium flame and add 2 tsp olive oil in it. Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds and allow them to crackle.</li>
        <li>Add spices and boiled potatoes and cook for a while - Now, add whole coriander seeds, ginger and green chilli. Saute for a minute and then add chopped cashews and raisins, peanuts if you like them, boiled and mashed potatoes, cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, red chilli powder, salt to taste, kasoori methi leaves, coriander leaves. Mix well and saute for 2 minutes. Your stuffing is ready!</li>
        <li>Prepare the dough for the Samosa - Now, to prepare the dough, take a mixing bowl and combine all-purpose flour along with carom seeds and salt. Mix and then add ghee and start kneading by adding a little water at a time. Ensure that you add water gradually and make a firm dough. A soft dough will not make your samosas crispy. Cover the dough with a damp muslin cloth and keep aside for about half an hour.</li>
        <li>Roll the dough in small puris and cut into half - Once done, roll out few small-sized balls from the dough. Flatten them further with the help of your palms and then with a rolling pin. Give them a round shape and cut in half. Now dip your hands in water, fold the edges of the semi-circle in order to give it a cone shape.</li>
        <li>Fill the semi-circle with potato filling and deep fry - Take the filling with the help of a spoon and stuff it in the cone. Seal the ends properly by pressing the edges lightly with your fingers. Then, heat olive oil in a pan and deep fry the samosas on low heat until they turn golden brown and crispy. Serve with tomato ketchup and green chutney. Enjoy it as a tea-time snack!</li>
